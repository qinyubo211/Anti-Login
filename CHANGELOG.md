# Changelog

All notable changes to Anti-Login are documented here.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-05

- Prepared the first public open-source release.
- Retained account hosting, standard anti-login monitoring, new-device alerts,
  subscriptions, payments, account transfer, and account maintenance tools.
- Removed the retired enhanced-protection and credential-based recovery
  features and their user-facing content.
- Added MIT licensing, security guidance, contribution guidance, and explicit
  attribution to 秦屿泊 (`@qinyubo`).
- Added a production-oriented Debian/Ubuntu deployment, systemd, backup,
  upgrade, rollback, and troubleshooting guide.
- Made the sync-warning rate-limit test independent of runner uptime so the
  Linux and Windows CI matrix is deterministic.
